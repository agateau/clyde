# Clyde

Clyde is a package manager for prebuilt applications.

## Motivation

You want to install the latest version of tools like ripgrep, fd or gh, but:

- They are not available in your distribution, or the available versions are too old, and you don't want to mess up your system.
- You don't want to have to think about where to install them, add them to $PATH, make their man page available, make auto-completion workâ€¦
- You don't want to remember how you installed them when it's time to update them.

You don't have root access on the machine where you need these tools, so installing system packages is not an option.

You want to pin the tool versions to create a reproducible platform.

You are concerned about supply-chain attacks? (see Security section)

## Installation

### Requirements

For now Clyde requires these tools to be installed:

- git: to download and update the Clyde store
- curl: to download archives
- tar: to unpack tar archives

This requirement list might get smaller in the future if more features are implemented internally.

### Installing Clyde

To get started, you need to download the Clyde binary yourself: Clyde can update itself, but it needs to be installed manually first. You can either:

- Get an archive from the [releases page](http://github.com/agateau/clyde/releases).

- Build it yourself. Clyde is written in Rust, so if you have the Rust toolchain installed, then you can clone its source code and install it with `clyde install --path .`.

## Getting started

1. Run `clyde setup`.

2. Add the created activation script to your shell startup script.

3. Restart your shell.

You are now ready to use Clyde. Let's install ripgrep:

```
clyde install ripgrep
```

Check it works:

```
rg --help
```

Check you can read its man page:

```
man rg
```

## Commands

### `clyde setup`

Setup Clyde: install Clyde store, and create an activation script. All changes are done in the "Clyde prefix" (see "Folder hierarchy" section)

### `clyde update`

Update Clyde store.

### `clyde install foobar[@version]`

Install `foobar` package, following the `@version` restriction if set.

### `clyde uninstall foobar`

Uninstalls the `foobar` package. Can also be called as `clyde remove foobar`.

### `clyde show foobar`

Shows details about `foobar` package.

### `clyde search foobar`

Search Clyde store for a package matching "foobar" in its name or description.

### `clyde upgrade`

Upgrade all packages to the latest version. If a package has been installed with an `@version` restriction, enforce it.

## Security

Is Clyde more secure than `curl <url> | bash`?

Yes, but it still requires you to be careful.

It is more secure in that the Clyde store contains the sha256 checksum of all archives, making it more complicated for an attacker to trick you into installing a corrupted archive.

This means if an attacker takes over the GitHub account of an app developer and replace some release artifacts with others, Clyde will refuse to install them. It does not protect however from the case where the attacker releases a new version of the application. To protect against this you need to pin the version numbers.

Clyde does not sandbox the applications.

Clyde installs binaries produced by app developers, it does not rebuild them (unlike projects like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)).

## Internals

### Clyde YAML format

```yaml
name: foobar
description: Foo Bar Baz
releases:
  "1.2.3":
    x86_64-linux:
      url: https://example.com/foobar/foobar-1.2.3-x86_65-linux.tar.gz
      sha256: 1234567890abcdef

  "1.2.1":
    x86_64-linux:
      url: https://example.com/foobar/foobar-1.2.1-x86_65-linux.tar.gz
      sha256: 1234567890abcdef

installs:
  # `install` command is going to use the highest version <= version to install.
  #
  # This means if you have files entries for 1.2.0 and 1.3.0, then installing
  # 1.3.4 would use the 1.3.0 files entries. Installing 1.2.4 would use the
  # 1.2.0 entries.
  "1.2.0":
    any:
      # instructions for all arch-os

      # Ignore first level of directory
      strip: 1
      files:
        bin/foo-*: bin/foo
        # This is the same as bin/bar: bin/bar
        bin/bar:
        man/*: share/man
        README.md share/doc/foobar/README.md
    any-macos:
      # macOS special instructions
```

### Folder hierarchy

The default prefix is a `clyde` directory created in the cache directory. The location of this cache depends on your OS:
- Linux: `$HOME/.cache/clyde` by default
- Windows: `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}/clyde/cache`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Caches/clyde`

The prefix can be defined using the `$CLYDE_PREFIX` environment variable.

Packages are all installed in $prefix/inst.

Packages must follow these rules:
- install binaries in $prefix/inst/bin
- install man pages in $prefix/inst/share/man
- install bash completion files in $prefix/inst/share/completion/bash
- install zsh completion files in $prefix/inst/share/completion/zsh

Clyde store DB is checked out in $prefix/store.

### Installed DB

Installed DB is stored in $prefix/clyde.sqlite.

#### Tables

```
installed_package:
- *name*
- installed_version
- requested_version

installed_file:
- *path*
- package_name
```
