## 0.8.0 - 2024-06-16

### Added

- It is now possible to install assets which are scripts.

- `clyde doc` now also shows the repository and homepage URLs, making it easy to open them.

### Changed

- Clyde no longer uses the `tar` command to unpack tar archives (Fixes #4).

### Fixed

- Fix regression in `clydetools fetch` preventing it from updating packages that use the default fetcher.

- Quitting `clyde doc` with Ctrl+C now properly restores the terminal cursor.

- `clydetools fetch` now prefers assets with explicit arch and OS (fixes gitui update failure).
