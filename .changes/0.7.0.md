## 0.7.0 - 2024-04-01

### Added

- Clyde got a new command: `clyde doc` to let you read the documentation provided by a package.

- Clyde releases now include binaries for Mac M1 processors.

- `clydetools` can now download packages from Forgejo forges.

- `clydetools fetch` can now select a subset of the project assets using the new `include` fetcher entry.

### Changed

- `clyde install` no longer overwrites existing files. If a file it wants to install already exists, it aborts and removes any files it just installed.

- `clydetools check` now provides a nicer and more detailed summary of package failures.
