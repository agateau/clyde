## 0.3.1 - 2022-09-07

### Changed

- `clydetools add-assets` and `clydetools fetch` no longer download more than one URL per arch-os.

### Fixed

- `clyde show -l <package>` now works even for packages installed from outside the store.

- When `clydetools` writes package files, it no longer writes `strip: 0`.

- Unpacking of single-file executables compressed with xz now works as expected.
