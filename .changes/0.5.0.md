## 0.5.0 - 2023-03-20

### Added

- `clydetools fetch` can now fetch updates for packages hosted on gitlab.com.

- `clyde setup` learned the `--url` option to define the URL of the store.

- Clyde packages can now install Bash and Zsh completion using the new `${bash_comp_dir}` and `${zsh_comp_dir}` variables (#20).

- `clyde install` learned the `--reinstall` option.

### Changed

- `clydetools` learned new patterns to extract arch-os from URLs.

- `clyde setup` now creates a shallow clone of the store, making it faster (#17).

- When a download times out, Clyde now retries 2 times before giving up.

### Fixed

- `clydetools fetch` could sometimes confuse cached assets if their name did not include the version number.

### Package format change

- A new entry has been added: `fetcher`. It makes it possible for the package to define the fetcher to use, and default values for the architecture and/or OS.
